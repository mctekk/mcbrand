The SalesAssist Solutions are not an advisory service and do not recommend or endorse any particular transaction, sales strategy or other approach to managing the sales process or Business’s process generally.",
              "The SalesAssist Solutions are intended only to facilitate the process by which Businesses complete sales. The SalesAssist Solutions do NOT offer any advice regarding the value, costs, profit targets, quality or suitability of any particular transaction, process or sales strategy. Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of any data or information that may be input or otherwise loaded into any SalesAssist Solution. Customer also assumes sole and complete responsibility for any documents, forms, payments and other content and materials that may be generated by or through any SalesAssist Solution (“Generated Content”), and Customer shall ensure the accuracy and completeness of all Generated Content (including any information entered by Customer or their clients in any form, document, contract or any Generated Content) prior to submitting or otherwise making aggregating such Generated Content to any SOR or any third party. SalesAssist and Customer agree to comply with all applicable legal obligations related to privacy, security, integrity, and confidentiality of data and will implement and maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed to protect against security threats and unauthorized access or use of the SalesAssist Solutions (including Integrated Information). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer alone is responsible for ensuring that Business and its Authorized Users and all Business Representatives (as defined herein) (a) comply with all federal, state (or, if applicable, provincial) and local laws, regulations, rules, ordinances and other decrees of any governmental authority, including any laws and regulations relating to privacy, security, integrity and confidentiality of Business’s customers’ information (“Laws”); (b) do not infringe or violate the Intellectual Property Rights (as defined herein) or any other rights of any third party; and (c) comply with all terms and conditions, terms of use and other agreements to which Customer or any Authorized User or Business Representative is or may be subject, in each case in connection with their use of the SalesAssist Solution(s) (including Integrated Information) and any Generated Content.

          "Access to Solutions. Customer and its Authorized Users may access and use the Solutions solely for its own benefit and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Customer and its Authorized Users may access the SalesAssist Solution(s) to which Customer is subscribed through the SalesAssist website located at www.SalesAssist.io, or such successor or replacement website or URL as SalesAssist may designate for such purpose (the “SalesAssist Site”). SalesAssist will issue to Customer a username and password to access the applicable SalesAssist Solution(s) as the admin user of such SalesAssist Solution(s) (the “Business Admin User”).

Any username, password or other login credential issued by Customer (or any Business Admin User) or SalesAssist to any Authorized User for use in accessing any SalesAssist Solution (including Integrated Information) or the SalesAssist Site is confidential and may not be shared with any third party. Any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Customer or Authorized User account information shall be immediately reported to SalesAssist in writing.

The license granted in this Section 2.4 includes access to basic email and chat technical support from SalesAssist with respect to the SalesAssist Solution(s). The license does not include any customization, programming or software or application development of any kind. Any such additional services must be agreed to by the parties in a separate written agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, an “Authorized User” means any officer or employee of Business that has been issued a username and password to access the SalesAssist Solution(s) for and on behalf of Customer, including any Business Admin User (as defined herein). Customer acknowledges that certain third parties have granted SalesAssist certain rights in connection with operation of, or integration of or with, an SalesAssist Solution (a “Third Party Licensor”). Customer further acknowledges that the SalesAssist Solution(s) may incorporate program code, data, files or other information as a direct result of SalesAssist’s (or its Affiliate’s) integration with a source of sales completion-related data, including Business’s management system, via an interface governed by an agreement between SalesAssist and a Third Party Licensor (“Integrated Information”). Business shall be responsible and liable for all actions that may be taken by its Authorized Users in connection with their use of any SalesAssist Solution (including Integrated Information), the SalesAssist Site or any Generated Content, including any unauthorized use of any SalesAssist Solution or Generated Content, or any other violation of this Agreement.",

If SalesAssist makes access to any APIs available as part of the SalesAssist Solutions, SalesAssist reserves the right to place limits on access to such APIs (e.g., limits on numbers of calls or requests). Further, SalesAssist may monitor Customer's usage of such APIs and limit the number of calls or requests Customer may make if SalesAssist believes that Customer's usage is in breach of this Agreement or may negatively affect the Services (or otherwise impose liability on SalesAssist).",
          "Trial Subscriptions. If Customer receives free access or a trial or evaluation subscription to the Service (a “Trial Subscription”), then Customer may use the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for a period of thirty (30) days or such other period granted by SalesAssist (the “Trial Period”).
